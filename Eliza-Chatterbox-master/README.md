# EDAN40_Chatterbox

One of the most famous programs in the history of artificial intelligence is Joseph Weizenbaum's program Eliza. Written in the early sixties it emulates, or parodies, a Rogerian psychoanalyst who tries to make the patient talk about his or her deepest feelings by turning everything said into a question. Eliza's fame is due to the remarkable observation that many people found her seem so friendly and understanding. In fact some said she was the first analyst they had met who really listened.

Over the years Eliza has had many successors and the phenomenon she represents is now known as a chatterbot. A chatterbot is a program that attempts to simulate typed conversation, with the aim of at least temporarily fooling a human into thinking they are talking to another person.

Chatterbox is a simple Eliza-like project I completed while I was studying at Lund University, taking EDAN40 - Functional Programming. I developed the logic for the input data preparation, pattern matching, and result transformation. It is written in Haskell, and can be run simply from the command line on a system with Haskell GHC installed.
