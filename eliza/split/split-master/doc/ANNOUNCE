I am pleased to announce the release of Data.List.Split, which
provides a wide range of strategies and a unified combinator framework
for splitting lists with respect to some sort of delimiter.  It
strives to be flexible yet simple.  If you've ever wished there was a
simple 'split' function you could grab from Data.List, this is the
package for you---no matter which of the seventeen* slightly different
ways to split a list you actually need!  Just use one of the
prepackaged splitting strategies, or build your own with the
combinator library.

Get it from Hackage:

  cabal install split

Get the source:
